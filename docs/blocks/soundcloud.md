## SoundCloud

The SoundCloud block takes an image on the left side as a thumbnail and a SoundCloud iframe on the right side.
The iframe code can be retrieved, by clicking the share button on the SoundCloud page and selecting the embed tab.

It is not possible to use other iframes than SoundCloud iframes, as the iframe source is being validated.
